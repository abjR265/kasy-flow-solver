# ✅ Backend Deployment Complete!

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Copied ALL KASY_MVP Backend Logic
- ✅ **OCR Receipt Processing** (EXACT prompt from KASY_MVP lines 867-987)
  - Highly detailed number accuracy instructions
  - Confidence scoring
  - Markdown cleanup
  
- ✅ **Natural Language Parsing** (EXACT prompt from KASY_MVP lines 570-626)
  - Simple, proven prompt: just extracts amount + description
  - **This should now correctly handle "dinner 60 split with jack"**
  
- ✅ **Overlapping Splits** (EXACT logic from KASY_MVP lines 629-808)
  - Flexible pattern detection (half 1/2, group a/b, h1/h2, etc.)
  - Case-insensitive participant matching
  - Synthetic ID generation
  
- ✅ **Settlement Calculation** (Greedy algorithm from KASY_MVP)
  - Minimizes transaction count
  - Handles paid settlements
  - Payment profile integration
  
- ✅ **Badge Award Logic** (KASY_MVP lines 1078-1347)
  - Table Hero 🏅 (90% collected in 7 days)
  - Pay It Forward ⚡ (3 quick pays in a row)
  - Even Steven 💫 (100% collection in <3 days)
  - Monthly reset system
  
- ✅ **Reminder Logic** (Gentle Collector™)
  - T+24h, T+48h, T+7d schedule
  - Quiet hours (22:00-08:00)
  - User preferences
  
- ✅ **Database Schema**
  - Restored web app models (User, Group, Expense, Payment)
  - Kept KASY_MVP models (Message, Badge, UserStats, PaymentProfile, UserMapping)
  
- ✅ **TypeScript Errors Fixed**
  - All build errors resolved
  - Type-check passes ✅

### 2. Deployment Status
- ✅ Backend successfully deployed to Vercel
- **Latest deployment**: https://kasy-flow-solver-h5mlg3rzn-kasyai.vercel.app
- **Status**: ● Ready (27s build time)
- **Environment**: Production

### 3. Current Issue
⚠️ The deployment has **Vercel Authentication** protection enabled, which requires:
- Vercel SSO login, OR
- Protection bypass token

### 4. Next Steps (Manual)

#### Option A: Test with Vercel Auth
1. Visit the deployment URL in your browser
2. Log in with Vercel SSO
3. Test the API: https://kasy-flow-solver-h5mlg3rzn-kasyai.vercel.app/api/expenses/parse

#### Option B: Disable Deployment Protection
1. Go to https://vercel.com/kasyai/kasy-flow-solver-bck/settings/deployment-protection
2. Disable "Vercel Authentication" for production deployments
3. Redeploy

#### Option C: Update Frontend API URL
If the backend is working at `kasy-flow-solver-h5mlg3rzn-kasyai.vercel.app`, update the frontend's `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point to this URL.

## Testing the NLP Fix

Once authentication is bypassed, test:

```bash
curl https://kasy-flow-solver-h5mlg3rzn-kasyai.vercel.app/api/expenses/parse \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"dinner 60 split with jack"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "amount": 60,
  "description": "dinner",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

## Summary

**All 10 features from KASY_MVP have been copied to the backend!** 🎉

The backend code now:
- Uses the EXACT same OCR prompt as KASY_MVP ✅
- Uses the EXACT same NLP prompt as KASY_MVP ✅  
- Uses the EXACT same overlapping splits logic ✅
- Uses the EXACT same badge/settlement/reminder logic ✅

The only remaining issue is the Vercel deployment protection, which you can disable in the Vercel dashboard.
