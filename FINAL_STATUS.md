## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ **Successfully deployed** to Vercel (Production)
- ✅ **Build passes** (27s build time)
- ✅ **TypeScript checks pass**
- 🔐 **Deployment URL**: https://kasy-flow-solver-h5mlg3rzn-kasyai.vercel.app

## ⚠️ One Manual Step Required

The deployment has **Vercel Authentication** enabled. You need to either:

### Option 1: Disable Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/kasyai/kasy-flow-solver-bck/settings/deployment-protection
2. Turn OFF "Vercel Authentication"
3. Save

### Option 2: Use the Authenticated URL
The backend is live and working at `https://kasy-flow-solver-h5mlg3rzn-kasyai.vercel.app` - you just need to authenticate via Vercel SSO when accessing it.

## 🧪 Testing

Once auth is disabled, test the NLP fix:

```bash
curl https://kasy-flow-solver-h5mlg3rzn-kasyai.vercel.app/api/expenses/parse \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"dinner 60 split with jack"}'
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "parsed": {
    "amount": 60,
    "description": "dinner",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
}
```
