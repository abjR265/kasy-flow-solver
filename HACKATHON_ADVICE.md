# üéØ Hackathon Demo Strategy - Overall Advice

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well (Keep These!)
1. **NLP Expense Parsing** - "dinner 60 split with josh" works perfectly
2. **OCR Receipt Processing** - Upload receipt ‚Üí extract amount/merchant
3. **OCR Follow-up** - Upload receipt, then "split with jack" combines them
4. **Real-time Dashboard Updates** - Expenses appear immediately after creation
5. **Real vs Mock Data Toggle** - Great for demo flexibility
6. **Participant Count** - Now correctly shows 2 people (payer + other)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Low Priority for Demo)

### 1. **Clear Database CORS Issue**
- **Problem**: DELETE requests blocked by CORS (Vercel caching issue)
- **Workaround Applied**: Changed to POST /api/expenses/clear endpoint
- **Demo Impact**: LOW - You can manually clear DB via Vercel dashboard or just create new expenses
- **For Demo**: Just don't use the clear button during live demo

### 2. **Receipts Tab Not Updating**
- **Problem**: The "Receipts" page (`/receipts`) shows mock/fixture data, not real expenses
- **Why**: The Receipts page was built for the initial UI mockup and hasn't been wired to the backend
- **Demo Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Options**:
  - **Option A (Quick - 5 min)**: Hide the "Receipts" tab for the demo
  - **Option B (Medium - 30 min)**: Wire Receipts tab to fetch real expenses with `receiptImageUrl`
  - **Option C (Best - 1 hr)**: Full integration with filtering and receipt-specific features
- **Recommendation**: **Hide it for now** (Option A)

### 3. **Payments Tab Not Updating**
- **Problem**: Similar to Receipts - shows mock data from fixtures
- **Why**: The Payments page needs to be wired to fetch real Payment records
- **Demo Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Options**:
  - **Option A (Quick - 5 min)**: Hide the "Payments" tab for the demo
  - **Option B (Medium - 45 min)**: Wire Payments tab to backend `/api/payments` endpoint
  - **Option C (Best - 2 hrs)**: Full integration with mark-as-paid, payment history, etc.
- **Recommendation**: **Hide it for now** (Option A)

## üéØ Recommended Demo Flow (Focus on What Works!)

### Demo Script:
1. **Start**: "KASY is an AI-powered expense splitting app"
2. **Show NLP**: 
   - Type: "dinner 60 split with josh"
   - Show: AI parses it correctly ‚Üí "Split between 2 people"
   - Click: "Confirm & Split"
   - Result: Expense appears immediately in Recent Expenses
3. **Show OCR**: 
   - Upload a receipt photo
   - Show: AI extracts merchant + amount automatically
   - Type: "split with alice"
   - Show: AI combines OCR amount with participant extraction
   - Click: "Confirm & Split"
   - Result: Expense appears with receipt image
4. **Show Real Data**: 
   - Toggle between "Real Data" and "Mock Data"
   - Emphasize: "This is connected to a live PostgreSQL database"
5. **Highlight Features**:
   - Natural language understanding
   - OCR + NLP combination
   - Real-time updates
   - Clean UI with Shadcn components

### What to Say When Asked About Missing Features:
- **Receipts Tab**: "We focused on the core expense creation flow for this demo. The receipts feature is in our roadmap for post-hackathon"
- **Payments Tab**: "The payment settlement engine is working in the backend (from our Telegram bot), we just prioritized the expense input UX for this demo"
- **Settlements/Calculations**: "The backend has full settlement calculation logic from our production Telegram bot, we're iterating on the web UI"

## üöÄ Quick Wins for Demo Polish (Optional - 15 min total)

### If You Have Time:
1. **Hide Unused Tabs** (5 min):
   - Remove "Receipts" and "Payments" links from navigation
   - Show only "Dashboard" for the demo
   
2. **Add Loading States** (5 min):
   - Show spinner while NLP is processing
   - Show "Uploading..." when processing receipt
   
3. **Better Error Messages** (5 min):
   - Instead of "Failed to parse", show helpful examples

## üìä Technical Architecture to Mention

### Stack:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js 14 API Routes + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for NLP + GPT-4o Vision for OCR
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend + Backend)
- **Monorepo**: Frontend (root) + Backend (`/backend`) in single repo

### Key Features Working:
1. ‚úÖ Natural Language Expense Parsing
2. ‚úÖ OCR Receipt Processing
3. ‚úÖ Multi-step Conversation Flow (OCR ‚Üí Follow-up)
4. ‚úÖ Real-time Database Integration
5. ‚úÖ Participant Management
6. ‚úÖ Expense History

### Backend Features (Not Shown in UI):
- Settlement calculation algorithm (greedy netting)
- Badge/reputation system
- Payment tracking
- Cron job for reminders
- All from production Telegram bot (KASY_MVP)

## üé¨ Final Recommendation

**For a 1-month hackathon demo, you have TWO solid options:**

### Option 1: Focus on Core Flow (Recommended ‚úÖ)
- **Time**: Ready NOW
- **What**: Show Dashboard only (NLP + OCR + Real Data)
- **Hide**: Receipts/Payments/Vaults tabs
- **Strength**: Clean, focused demo of AI-powered expense creation
- **Message**: "This is our core innovation - AI-powered expense splitting"

### Option 2: Full Feature Integration
- **Time**: 3-4 hours more work
- **What**: Wire up Receipts, Payments, Settlements tabs to backend
- **Strength**: Shows full product vision
- **Risk**: More things that can break during demo

**My Advice**: Go with **Option 1**. Your core NLP + OCR flow is impressive and works perfectly. Better to have 3 features that work flawlessly than 10 features where half are buggy. You can always say "we have more features in development" and show the backend code if asked.

## üî• What Makes Your Demo Stand Out

1. **Real AI Integration**: Not fake AI - actually using GPT-4o-mini + Vision
2. **Telegram Bot Heritage**: Backend is battle-tested from your production bot
3. **Smart OCR Follow-up**: Not just OCR - it combines with NLP for context
4. **Clean UX**: Shadcn UI components look professional
5. **Real Database**: Not localStorage - actual PostgreSQL with Prisma

This is a solid demo! Don't overthink it. üöÄ
